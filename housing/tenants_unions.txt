0. Relative to tenants' unions
1. Copy and paste all New Hampshire law governing the organization of labor
   unions, and then do a find-and-replace to change all instances of "workers"
   to "tenants", and "bosses" to "landlords".
2. Edit all existing New Hampshire law to modify all laws governing
   tenant-landlord interaction to include any tenants' union that that tenant
   may be a part of in that interaction. For example, "The landlord must
   notify the tenant," would become, "The landlord must notify the tenant, and
   any tenants' union that that tenant may be part of," and, "A tenant may
   refuse to pay rent if the landlord refuses to perform maintenance for that
   tenant," would become, "A tenant may refuse to pay rent if the landlord
   refuses to perform maintenance for that tenant, or if the landlord refuses
   to perform maintenance for any other tenant in that building, and then the
   tenants' union to which both of those tenants belong vote by majority to
   collectively go on a rent strike as a union."
