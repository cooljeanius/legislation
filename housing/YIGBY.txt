- Get in touch with Bob Harb
- diffs between NHMA's language and existing HB1021 language:
 * change "site plan review" to "local land use regulation"
 * change "primarily used for religious purposes" to "based solely on the
   religious nature of the use"
 * second clause: split off from first, completely reworded

From ChatGPT in response to the prompt "If a religious organization builds housing for the unhoused in accordance with the tenets of their religious creed, does that count as 'religious exercise' protected by the First Amendment?" on December 7, 2022:

Yes, building housing for the unhoused in accordance with the tenets of a
religious organization's creed would likely be considered "religious exercise"
protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution. The First Amendment
protects the freedom of religion, which includes the right to express and practice
one's religious beliefs without interference from the government.

In the context of building housing for the unhoused, providing this service in
accordance with the religious organization's beliefs would likely be considered
an expression of those beliefs. As such, the government would be prohibited from
interfering with or restricting the organization's ability to provide this service.
This protection would extend to any other activities that the organization may
engage in as part of their religious exercise, such as providing meals or other
forms of assistance to the unhoused.

It is important to note that the First Amendment's protection of religious exercise
is not absolute. In some cases, the government may be able to regulate religious
exercise if it can demonstrate that such regulation is necessary to serve a
compelling government interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
However, in the case of a religious organization building housing for the unhoused,
it is unlikely that the government would be able to justify any such regulation.
