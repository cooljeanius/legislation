0. Relative to apartment entry systems
1. No landlord, whether public or private, shall require any tenant to own a
   landline telephone in order to connect to an apartment intercom system that
   allows the granting of door access to people calling up from the lobby, if such
   a system would work equally well for letting people in without also being
   connected to an external telephone network.
