Since a straight-up ban on parking minimums couldn't pass, this file is just for
brainstorming some alternative conditions under which parking minimums could be
limited.

0. Relative to Parking Mandates
1. No municipality shall institute a zoning ordinance that requires new housing
   developments to include a minimum number of parking places, unless (choose at
   least one of the following):
   a. they also institute a zoning ordinance that places a maximum limit on the
      number of parking places a new housing development may have
   b. the area in question (is/isn't) served by municipal water & sewer
   c. there are no viable public transportation services serving the area in
      question
   d. the affected properties are of a certain size
   e. it (is/isn't) a designated downtown area / historic district / town center
   f. (other?)
2. Any municipality that does institute a zoning ordinance requiring new housing
   developments to include a minimum number of parking places shall also allow
   bike racks and/or bus stops to count as parking places.
