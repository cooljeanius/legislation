0. Relative to a right to inspect source code of rent-setting software for tenants
1. If a landlord doesn't grant tenants a right to inspect the source code of
   software used to set their rent, then the tenants may go on rent strike.
2. There is to be a right to inspect the source code of software used in
   rent-setting at eviction hearings. If, upon exercising their right to inspect
   the source code of rent-setting software, the tenant finds that landlord was
   engaged in price-fixing, the tenant shall win their case, and shall not be
   evicted.

This became LSR 24-2328, "prohibiting termination of a tenancy based on a tenant's
failure to pay rent that was increased by certain price fixing programs."
It then became HB1368: https://gencourt.state.nh.us/lsr_search/billText.aspx?id=1415&type=4
