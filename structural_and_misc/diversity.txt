0. Relative to state demographics
1. The State of New Hampshire acknowledges that its relative lack of diversity
   is a threat to its First-In-The-Nation Primary status, and as a result, shall
   create a study committee that shall study how to increase our state's diversity
   by the time of our next presidential primary, including, but not limited to,
   possibly choosing a percentage to use for a diversity target.
