0. Relative to state demographics
1. The State of New Hampshire acknowledges that its relative lack of diversity
   is a threat to its First-In-The-Nation Primary status, and as a result, shall
   create a study committee that shall study how to increase our state's diversity
   by the time of our next presidential primary, including, but not limited to,
   possibly choosing a percentage to use for a diversity target.
(TODO: update with Census data)

Alternative idea: codify and give a statutory basis for the Governor's Council on
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (or whatever it is)?

New tactic: have the Commission on Demographic Trends handle it:

(This became LSR 2022-2491)
It then became HB1294:

It failed due to trying to amend a portion of the law that had gotten removed,
so I'm reintroducing it as LSR 2023-0185.
