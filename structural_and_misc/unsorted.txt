This file is for legislation ideas that I haven't chosen another folder for yet.

6. Ban on lawn mandates: https://xcancel.com/snowofthefuture/status/1531106462486888449
   (...or maybe it's actually frontage requirements that I want to do something
   about?)
7. Municipal land use regulations database: tweak RSA 675:9 (dunno how)

16. Official IPA pronunciation for "New Hampshire" (/nuːˈhæmpʃər/) and "Concord"

18. Something about rent payments vs. credit scores:
    https://xcancel.com/ninaturner/status/1600899030623879169
    (maybe fold in with the "right to inspect" one in
    housing/rent_setting_software.txt?)
19. State version of the federal "Linemen Legacy Act":
    https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/398/all-info?r=3&s=1
    (except more inclusive: also incorporating active-duty power systems
    personnel on grid and power distribution works, e.g., for substations and
    generating plants) (filed LSR 24-2333, "relative to establishing an electrical
    line technician recognition day," but then withdrew it because that wasn't
    actually what I wanted)
20. Resolution reaffirming NH's support for the Child Labor Amendment; see the one
    that was recently introduced in MN:
    https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF3275&version=latest&session=93&session_number=0&session_year=2023
    (Ellen has contacts in other states) (filed LSR 24-2335, "reaffirming support
    for the child labor amendment to the United States Constitution.", which then
    became HR24, and then passed the House... I'm not sure what happened to it
    after that, though...)
21. Check if House Rules protect testimony before House Committee Hearings from
    being used against people in court (check with Amanda Grady Sexton of NHCADSV?)
    Became LSR 24-2324, "relative to establishing immunity for certain testimony
    in public legislative hearings.", which then became HB1367:
    https://gencourt.state.nh.us/lsr_search/billText.aspx?id=1411&type=4
22. Something about municipalities building sidewalks on state-owned land (check
    that bill Jeb Bradley had before our committee in the 21-22 term about One
    Touch Make Ready rules - it was SB88, heard on May 10, 2021) (filed LSR
    24-2430, "relative to requests for easements for the purpose of laying
    sidewalk along class I-IV highways.", which then became HB1196)
    TODO: follow up with DOT guy about this
23. (autism registry one moved to tech/Autism_Registry.html.diff) (filed LSR
    24-2428, "relative to the autism registry.", which then became HB1615,
    and was later signed into law)
24. dog/cat cafés... check first to see what (if anything) is preventing them?
25. libraries accepting cat pics in lieu of fines:
    https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/cat-photos-replace-library-fines
26. Study committee re: clothing size standardization, and participation in
    standards bodies in general... do NH National Guard uniforms comply with
    STANAG 2335?
27. Municipal mascots, like they have in Japan:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuru-chara
28. Something about private equity; term to look for is "leveraged buyout"
    apparently...
29. Electroshock therapy: check informed consent requirement, and age limits?
30. To put somewhere in the tech subdir (or maybe the education one?) at some
    point: WA HB2360: https://legiscan.com/WA/bill/HB2360/2023
31. Freedom of Panorama (FOP) for NH Historical Markers:
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/Files_in_Category:Historical_markers_in_New_Hampshire
    (alternate idea: require that if the state is going to assert copyright
     over its historical markers, it's gotta be under a copyleft license?)
