0. Relative to prosecution of white collar crime
1. All police departments in the state of New Hampshire at all levels of government
   (state, county, municipal) shall be required to have units devoted to the
   investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.
2. No new funding shall be allocated for the creation of these white collar crime
   units. Instead, police departments shall transfer funding from any of their
   other units to fund the creation of these new units.

(TODO: research the status of any such existing units)
