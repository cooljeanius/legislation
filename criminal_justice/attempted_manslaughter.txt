0. Relative to attempted manslaughter
1. Consider the following table of crimes, with the defendant's intended result
   along the top, and the defendant's state of mind along the side:

            | kill             | harm             |
------------+------------------+------------------+
intentional | attempted murder | 1st deg. assault |
------------+------------------+------------------+
impaired    | ???              | 2nd deg. assault |
------------+------------------+------------------+

Currently, it is this legislator's understanding that there is no New Hampshire
state law applicable to the box with the question marks. This legislation,
therefore, proposes to create the new crime of "attempted manslaughter" to
apply this situation. Just as manslaughter carries a lighter sentence than
murder does, and 2nd degree assault carries a lighter sentence than 1st degree
assault does, so too shall attempted manslaughter carry with it a lighter
sentence than attempted murder does. However, the sentence for attempted
manslaughter shall still be harsher than that of 2nd degree assault. As far
as the relationship between the sentence between the sentence carried by
attempted manslaughter and the sentence between 1st degree assault goes, that
shall be left to the discretion of the sentencing judge presiding in any such
cases.
