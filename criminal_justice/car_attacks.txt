0. Relative to vehicular homicides
1. NH RSA [TODO: lookup number] is hereby clarified to specify that being stuck
   in traffic is not detainment, nor is it an instance of false imprisonment,
   nor is it valid cause for a defense of "self-defense" in any murder case
   resulting from any driver believing that they have been made a victim of
   such a false "false imprisonment".
