0. Relative to vehicular homicides
1. NH RSAs 627 and 633 are hereby clarified to specify that being stuck
   in traffic is not detainment, nor is it an instance of false imprisonment,
   nor is it valid cause for a defense of "self-defense" in any murder case
   resulting from any driver believing that they have been made a victim of
   such a false "false imprisonment". Note that this is already current law, and
   so this legislation merely clarifies existing statute.

(see edits to existing NH law in this directory in files 627-mrg.htm and
633-mrg.htm and check on GitHub for how their diffs look)

(this got split into LSR 2022-2253 and LSR 2022-2255, so I withdrew the first one
and had it merged back into the second one)
It then became HB1145:
