0. Relative to simple assault
1. Whereas there is a glut of simple assault cases clogging up the New
   Hampshire court system, state law governing simple assaults shall be
   changed as follows: unpriviliged physical contact is not sufficient to
   justify a simple assault charge. Charges of simple assault must also
   contain assertions of actual harm (whether physical, mental, or otherwise)
   in order to be valid. This harm need not be as severe as that which is
   required in more severe assault cases (such as 1st degree or 2nd degree
   assault), however, it must still be harm.
1a. Alternative to section 1: instead of changing the definition of simple assault,
   allow permission to be granted retroactively.

(this was just an idea that came to me during jury duty; it might not actually be
such a good idea though...)
