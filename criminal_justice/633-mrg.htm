<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(1) Upon process issued by any justice, associate justice, or special justice of the district or superior court. The court may issue a seizure warrant on an affidavit under oath demonstrating that probable cause exists for its forfeiture or that the property has been the subject of a previous final judgment of forfeiture in the courts of any state or of the United States. The application for process and the issuance, execution, and return of process shall be subject to applicable state law. The court may order that the property be seized and secured on such terms and conditions as are reasonable in the discretion of the court. Such order may include an order to a financial institution or to any fiduciary or bailee to require the entity to impound any property in its possession or control and not to release it except upon further order of the court.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(b) A seizure for forfeiture without process under subparagraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) shall be reasonable if made under circumstances in which a warrantless seizure or arrest would be valid in accordance with state law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">IV. Upon seizure of any items or property interests the property shall not be subject to alienation, sequestration, or attachment but is deemed to be in the custody of the department of justice subject only to the order of the court.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">V. Upon the seizure of any personal property, the person making or directing such seizure shall inventory the items or property interests and issue a copy of the resulting report to any person or persons having a recorded interest, or claiming an equitable interest in the item within 7 days of the seizure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">VI. Upon seizure of any real property, the person making or directing such seizure shall notify any person having a recorded interest or claiming an equitable interest in the property within 7 days of the seizure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">VII. The seizing agency shall cause an appraisal to be made of the property as soon as possible and shall promptly send to the department of justice a written request for forfeiture. This request shall include a statement of all facts and circumstances supporting forfeiture of the property, including the names of all witnesses then known, and the appraised value of the property.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">VIII. The department of justice shall examine the facts and applicable law of the cases referred pursuant to paragraph VII, and if it is probable that the property is subject to forfeiture, shall cause the initiation of administrative or judicial proceedings against the property. If upon inquiry and examination, the department of justice determines that such proceedings probably cannot be sustained or that the ends of justice do not require the institution of such proceedings, the department shall make a written report of such findings and send a copy to the seizing agency, and, if appropriate, shall also authorize and direct the release of the property.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">IX. The department of justice shall, within 60 days of the seizure, file a petition in the superior court having jurisdiction under this section.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XI. The court may order forfeiture of all items or property interests under this section, except no item or property interest shall be subject to forfeiture unless the owner or owners thereof were consenting parties to a felonious violation of this section and had knowledge thereof.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XII. The department of justice may petition the superior court in the name of the state in the nature of a proceeding in rem to order forfeiture of items or property interests subject to forfeiture under the provisions of this section. Such petition shall be filed in the court having jurisdiction over any related criminal proceedings which could be brought under this section. Such proceeding shall be deemed a civil suit in equity in which the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by a preponderance of the evidence and in which the owners or other persons claiming an exception pursuant to paragraph XI shall have the burden of proving such exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XIII. The court shall issue summonses to all persons who have a recorded interest or claim an equitable interest in said items or property interests seized under this section and shall schedule a hearing on the petition to be held within 90 days of the service date specified by the court on the summons on said petition.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XIV. At the request of any party to the forfeiture proceeding, the court shall grant a continuance until the final resolution of any criminal proceedings which were brought against a party under this section and which arose from the transaction which gave rise to the forfeiture proceeding. No party's interest in property shall be forfeited unless a party has been found guilty of the underlying felonious charge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XV. At the hearing, the court shall hear evidence and make findings of fact and rulings of law as to whether the property is subject to forfeiture under this section. Except in the case of proceeds, upon a finding that the property is subject to forfeiture the court shall determine whether the forfeiture of the property is not excessive in relation to the underlying criminal offense. In making this determination the court shall consider whether in addition to any other pertinent considerations:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(a) There is a substantial connection between the property to be forfeited and the underlying offense;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(b) Criminal activities conducted by or through the use of the property were extensive; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(c) The value of the property to be forfeited greatly outweighs the cost of prosecution and the harm caused by the criminal conduct.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XVI. The court shall, thereupon, make a final order, from which all parties shall have a right of appeal. Final orders for forfeiture of property under this section shall be implemented by the department of justice and shall provide for disposition of the items or property interests by the state in any manner not prohibited by law, including payment of restitution to a victim of trafficking or sale at public auction. The department of justice shall pay the reasonable expenses of the forfeiture proceeding, seizure, storage, maintenance of custody, advertising, court costs, and notice of sale from any money forfeited and from the proceeds of any sale or public auction of forfeited items. All outstanding recorded liens on said items or property interests seized shall be paid in full upon conclusion of the court proceedings from the proceeds of any sale or public auction of forfeited items.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XVII. Overseas assets of persons convicted of trafficking in persons shall also be subject to forfeiture to the extent they can be retrieved by the government.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">XVIII. After payment of costs outlined in paragraph XVI, any forfeited money and the proceeds of any sale or public auction of forfeited items shall first be used to satisfy any order of restitution or compensation imposed by the court. Any remaining funds shall go to the victims' assistance fund as defined in RSA 21-M:8-i.</span></p>
