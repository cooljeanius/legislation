From ChatGPT:

Mutual aid, as described by the Russian anarchist and scientist Peter Kropotkin,
is a form of voluntary cooperation between individuals or groups that is based on
a shared interest or goal. Kropotkin believed that mutual aid was a natural and
important aspect of human society, and that it was essential for the survival and
progress of communities. He argued that mutual aid was more effective and
beneficial than competition and individualism in meeting the needs of individuals
and promoting social harmony.

The recognition of mutual aid by governments varies depending on the specific
government and its political and social priorities. In some cases, governments may
actively support and promote mutual aid as a way of fostering community
development and cooperation. For example, they may provide funding or resources
to support mutual aid organizations or initiatives, or they may enact policies
that encourage or incentivize mutual aid. In other cases, governments may be less
supportive of mutual aid, and may view it as a potential threat to their own
power and authority. In these situations, governments may restrict or suppress
mutual aid activities, or may attempt to co-opt or control them. Overall, the
recognition and support of mutual aid by governments is likely to depend on a
variety of factors, including the specific context and the political climate in
which it takes place.
