From ChatGPT in response to the prompt "How do worker-owned cooperatives and
customer-owned cooperatives differ?" on December 4, 2022:

Worker-owned cooperatives and customer-owned cooperatives are two types of
cooperative businesses that are structured and operated differently. A
worker-owned cooperative is a business that is owned and controlled by its
employees. In a worker-owned cooperative, the workers elect a board of directors
and make decisions about the business democratically, with each worker having an
equal vote. The workers also share the profits of the business among themselves.
A customer-owned cooperative, on the other hand, is a business that is owned and
controlled by its customers. In a customer-owned cooperative, the customers elect
a board of directors and make decisions about the business democratically, with
each customer having an equal vote. The customers also share the profits of the
business among themselves. The main difference between these two types of
cooperatives is who owns and controls the business, with worker-owned
cooperatives being owned by the workers and customer-owned cooperatives being
owned by the customers.
