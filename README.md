# legislation
This repository contains drafts of LSRs (Legislative Support Requests) I
intend to file, am filing, or have filed previously as a legislator. They
are very rough drafts and in most cases require further work. This repo
is also being served in the form of a website at the following URL: 
https://cooljeanius.github.io/legislation/

For further discussion, please subscribe to the legislation-discuss mailing
list being hosted by the Software Freedom Conservancy, and remind me to
actually use it:
