# legislation
This repository contains drafts of LSRs (Legislative Support Requests) I
intend to file as a legislator. They are very rough drafts and in most cases
require further work.

Note that in some cases I am choosing not to state my justification for
proposing such legislation, as courts can sometimes take statements made
around the drafting of legislation as evidence of certain legislative intent,
and I want to make sure I have my justifications worded as carefully as
possible to ensure that any legislation I do end up filing and passing
survives possible court challenges.
