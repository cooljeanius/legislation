Contributing
============

Contributing is welcome, although please be aware that since this represents my own ideas for legislation, any contributions would have to be ones I agree with. Thus, please see the following breakdown of what a hypothetical contributor's thought processes might look like for contributions I'd accept, vs. those I'd reject (with "you" referring to me):

Good motivations for contributions:

- ✅ "I saw one of your `TODO:` comments in the code and decided to complete it"
- ✅ "I get the idea of what you're going for here, and figured out a way to make it work even better"
- ✅ "I've seen your postings on other platforms about the sorts of policies and philosophies you support, and think that the following statutory changes might help enable them"

Bad motivations for contribution attempts:

- ❌ "I have a fundamental philosophical disagreement with your changes here"
- ❌ "I don't like where you're going with this and decided to move in the opposite direction instead"
- ❌ "I'm a troll and am trying to shoehorn something unrelated into one of your bills where it doesn't belong"
