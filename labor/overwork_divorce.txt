0. Relative to divorces caused by overwork
1. In any divorce case heard in family courts in the State of New Hampshire, if
that divorce is found to be [at least partially? wholly? largely?] caused by
employer-induced overwork, that employer may be found liable for any damages
assessed as part of the divorce, including, but not limited to, any child support
payments owed due to the divorce.
2. Only claims of overwork made in good faith shall be considered for the purposes
of damages assessed pursuant to this act.
3. Any divorcee who seeks damages from their employer in accordance with this act,
who fails to meet the threshold for overwork as determined by the courts, shall...
[meet with some sort of consequence designed to prevent this act from being abused]

(maybe this should be done as part of workman's comp instead of divorce courts?)
