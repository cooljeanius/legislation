0. Relative to labor unions
1. The right to strike (guarantee it for all professions, including teachers)
   (Tony Labranche did a separate CACR towards this end in the 2021-2022 term;
   if bringing it back, consider modifying it to more closely match the state
   constitutional amendment that Illinois passed at the ballot box in the 2022
   midterms)
2. Non-disparagement clauses (ban employers from requiring them) - see recent NLRB
   decision:
   https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7a7x/companies-cant-ask-you-to-shut-up-to-receive-severance-nlrb-rules
   (this part became LSR 24-2456, "relative to severance agreements requiring
   employees to broadly waive labor law rights.", which then became HB1375)
   (unfortunately I forgot to cite the NLRB case when presenting HB1375, so maybe
   come back with a version that more explicitly references it?)
