Research request status as of August 10, 2023: filed, in progress

From ChatGPT in response to the prompt "Are job postings covered by false advertising law?" on December 4, 2022:

In general, job postings are not covered by false advertising law. False
advertising refers to the practice of making false or misleading claims about a
product or service in order to deceive consumers and gain an unfair advantage in
the marketplace. False advertising is regulated by laws such as the Federal Trade
Commission Act in the United States, which prohibits the use of false or
deceptive advertising practices.

However, job postings are typically not considered to be advertisements in the
same way that products or services are. Job postings are not intended to sell a
product or service, but rather to provide information about a job opportunity and
attract potential applicants. As such, they are not subject to the same
regulations and laws that apply to advertisements for products or services.

That being said, job postings are still subject to other laws and regulations
that govern employment practices. For example, job postings must not
discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, gender, religion, age, or
other protected characteristics. They must also provide accurate and truthful
information about the job duties, requirements, and compensation. If a job
posting contains false or misleading information, an applicant may have grounds
to challenge the posting or file a complaint with the appropriate authorities.
However, these challenges and complaints would not be based on false advertising
law, but rather on other laws and regulations that apply to employment practices.
