0. The title of this legislation shall be the "Truth In Job Postings And
   Applications Act".
1. No job application posted in the State of New Hampshire shall require applicants
   to lie in order to receive the advertised position.
2. No employer shall discriminate against any job applicant who has religious or
   moral scruples against lying, or an intellectual or developmental disability
   that inhibits their ability to lie.
3. Any job applicant who believes they have been discriminated against contrary to
   the provisions of this act shall be allowed to file suit against the employer
   by which they believe they have been discriminated against.
4. New Hampshire's Department of Employment Services shall alert any job seekers
   making use of their services as to the provisions of this legislation. This
   clause shall apply only to job seekers who ask for one-on-one job search
   assistance from Department of Employment Services employees.
5. No job posting for an entry-level position in the State of New Hampshire shall
   require applicants to have more prior experience than an entry-level applicant
   for such a position may be reasonably expected to have, as determined by the
   state's Department of Labor.
6. No unpaid internship posting in the State of New Hampshire shall include any
   experience requirement for applicants whatsoever.
7. Any job posting that includes false requirements for applicants shall be
   prosecutable under New Hampshire's false advertising laws.
8. All job postings in the State of New Hampshire shall include notice of how long
   the employer expects to take to respond to completed job applications. Any job
   applicant who notices a job application that fails to include this notice may
   report it to... (the Department of Labor? Department of Employment Security?
   I'm not sure...), who shall then [TODO]. Failure by an employer to respond to a
   job applicant's job application within the time they specified in their posting
   shall cause the employer to be liable for the time in which the applicant spent
   waiting to receive a reply.
9. No job posting for any position in the State of New Hampshire shall require a
   driver's license solely for identification purposes if a non-drivers ID would
   suffice. Possession of a driver's license may only be made a requirement for
   job applications where driving is absolutely necessary.

Other stuff to consider including:
- whether phone numbers (cell vs. landline) are necessary and/or could be used for
  discrimination
- whether mailing addresses (home vs. P.O. Box) are necessary and/or could be used
  for discrimination based on location, housing type (apt. vs. house), or otherwise
