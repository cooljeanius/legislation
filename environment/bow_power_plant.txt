0. Relative to the state electrical power supply
1. The state's Public Utilities Commission shall take climate change impact into
   account when setting prices for power plants to be allowed to run, such that
   power plants that contribute more greatly to climate change, based on carbon
   emissions or by pollution control device measurements, shall be required to
   pay higher rates. The climate change impact payments shall be made by the
   operators of the power plants in question, or the utilities, to the state, to
   fund the PUC's Sustainable Energy Division, or to the Systems Benefit Charge,
   or towards RGGI funds. Payments made to the latter two shall be put towards
   public housing retrofitting for energy efficiency and weatherization needs.

TODO: percentages... check CA, WA, IL...? If I can't find any specific percentages,
I'll just leave it to the PUC's discretion...
Would probably go before ST&E (Science, Technology, & Energy)

(This became LSR 2022-2264)

Other ideas: Commercial & Industrial (C&I) ratepayers shouldn't get RGGI bonus,
just residential ones instead?
