0. Relative to the use of school buses
1. The definition of an "adequate education" that the state is required to set
   pursuant to the Claremont Supreme Court decision shall include the provision of
   adequate public transportation to and from schools for both students and
   teachers.
2. Any teacher employed by a public school under the jurisdiction of the State of
   New Hampshire may request to be transported to and from the school at which they
   work by means of a school bus that would normally be provided for students. This
   request shall only be granted if the teacher's requested pick-up location is
   convenient for the bus driver, and if the school district can afford to pay
   the school bus driver for the additional driving.
