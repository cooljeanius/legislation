<br>
In this subdivision:
<br>
I. "Open data format" means the organization of digital data within a computer file in a manner that makes it accessible for all to implement and use in perpetuity, without payment of royalty or fee for the implementation of the format. In order for a data format to be considered an open data format, the published specification for it must be maintained by a multi-member standards organization, and must itself be published in an open data format.
<br>
I-a. "Open source software" means software that guarantees to any and all users, without discrimination:
<br>
(a) Unrestricted use of the software for any field of endeavor;
<br>
(b) Unrestricted access to the respective source code;
<br>
(c) Unlimited inspection of the working mechanisms of the software;
<br>
(d) Use of the internal mechanisms and arbitrary portions of the software, to adapt them to the needs of the user;
<br>
(e) The right to make and distribute copies of the software; and
<br>
(f) The right to modify the software and to distribute modifications of the new resulting software, under the same license as the original software.
<br>
II. "Open standards" means specifications for the encoding and transfer of computer data that:
<br>
(a) Is free for all to implement and use in perpetuity, with no royalty or fee;
<br>
(b) Has no restrictions on the use of data stored in the format;
<br>
(c) Has no restrictions on the creation of software that stores, transmits, receives, or accesses data codified in such way;
<br>
(d) Has a specification available for all to read, in a human-readable format, written in commonly accepted technical language;
<br>
(e) Is documented, so that anyone can write software that can read and interpret the complete semantics of any data file stored in the data format;
<br>
(f) If it allows extensions, ensures that all extensions of the data format used by the state are themselves documented and have the other characteristics of an open data format;
<br>
(g) Allows any file written in that format to be identified as adhering or not adhering to the format; and
<br>
(h) If it includes any use of encryption or other means of data obfuscation, provides that the encryption or obfuscation algorithms are usable in a royalty-free, nondiscriminatory manner in perpetuity, and are documented so that anyone in possession of the appropriate encryption key or keys or other data necessary to recover the original data is able to write software to access the data.
<br>
III. "Proprietary software" means software that does not fulfill all of the guarantees provided by open source software.
<br>
IV. "State agency" means any department, commission, board, institution, bureau, office, or other entity, by whatever name called, established in the state constitution, statutes, or executive orders. The judicial branch and the legislative branch of state government are explicitly exempted from this definition.
<br>
V. The purpose of defining these terms is to promote the use of open standards, software, and data formats, in order to make the operation of government more participatory and transparent, in accordance with Article 8 of the New Hampshire state bill of rights, and to provide the state with resilience against external disruptions of software supply chains.

<codesect>
<br>
I. The commissioner shall develop a statewide information policy based on the following principles of open government data. According to these principles, open data is data that is:
<br>
(a) Complete. All public data is made available, unless subject to valid privacy, security, or privilege limitations.
<br>
(b) Primary. Data is collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, rather than in aggregate or modified forms.
<br>
(c) Timely. Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.
<br>
(d) Accessible. Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.
<br>
(e) Machine processable. Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.
<br>
(f) Nondiscriminatory. Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.
<br>
(g) Nonproprietary. Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control, with the exception of national or international published standards.
<br>
(h) License-free. Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security, and privilege restrictions may be allowed.
<br>
II. The information policy developed under paragraph I shall include a mechanism for adoption and review by each state agency. Each agency that adopts the policy shall designate a contact person responsible for oversight and implementation of open government data standards for that agency. The contact shall act as a liaison between the department, the implementing agency, and the public in matters related to open government data standards.
<br>
III. In developing the open data standards policy, the commissioner shall solicit information from the secretary of state relative to state archiving practices and the collection of data for historical purposes.
