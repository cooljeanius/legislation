Notes about DHHS

- BIS (Bureau of Information Services within DHHS) - contracts out a lot
- vendor lock-in
- Informatica (SaaS)
- Sybase
- Tableau (affected by log4j, but vendor wouldn't patch, even though patch was
  available)
- they do actually have 1 RHEL machine! (originally from Deloitte)
- RedCap
- Oracle
- Salesforce
- kids who age out of DCYF often end up homeless - what happens with their data
  in that case?

ideas:
- Go back to bill filed w/Rep. Berezhny; review RFP process
- Just the definitions? (along with fraud / false advertising)
- Check over with DCYF - bill for web presence for publicly available data - I
  think this was HB551 from Rep. Corcoran? https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2023&id=595&txtFormat=html
- Cross-reference with autism database one: RSA 171-A:30-31 / NHCAR He-M 501
- just focus on getting data in open-standard formats (.csv)
- "interoperability" is preferred term for data portability
