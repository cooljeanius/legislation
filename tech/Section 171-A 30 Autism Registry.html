<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I. There shall be established a state registry in the department which shall include a record of all reported cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that occur in New Hampshire and other information relevant and appropriate to conduct thorough and complete epidemiologic surveys of ASD, to enable analysis of this problem, and to facilitate planning for services to children with ASD and their families. The department may enter into an agreement with an appropriate entity for the management of the registry; provided, that any records and data submitted to the department pursuant to this subdivision shall be the property of the department, as shall be the software used to store said data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">II. Physicians, psychologists, and any other licensed or certified health care provider who is qualified by training to make the diagnosis and who then makes the diagnosis that a child is affected with ASD shall report all new cases of this diagnosis to the department in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The report shall be in writing and shall include the name and address of the person submitting the report and the child's date of birth, and zip code at birth residence, and the specific diagnosis of the child diagnosed as having ASD. The department shall assign a unique identification code to identify the child diagnosed as having ASD. The code shall not include the name, address, or initials of the child, nor shall any other field in the registry. The person reporting this diagnosis shall also send a copy of the report to the diagnosed child's family, along with information about resources that are available to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
