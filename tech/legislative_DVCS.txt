0. Relative to how legislation is filed and tracked in the NH legislature
1. Definitions
 1a. Version Control System (VCS) [TODO]
 1b. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) [TODO]
 1c. Diffing [TODO]
 1d. Grepping [TODO]
2. Usage of VCS
The State of New Hampshire's legislature shall keep all legislative proposals filed
with it stored in a version control system, preferably a distributed one with a web
interface similar to that found on popular code-hosting websites such as GitHub.
The legislation shall be stored in this VCS in an open text-based format that
allows for easy diffing, grepping, and manipulation by other similar software tools
designed to operate on text-based formats. Amendments to legislation shall be
handled by tools provided by the VCS.
3. Something about GNU ethical repository criteria:

 3a. Require assessment of service used to host repo, and publication of
 assessment if one doesn't already exist
