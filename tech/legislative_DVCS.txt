2. Usage of VCS
The State of New Hampshire's legislature shall keep all legislative proposals filed
with it stored in a version control system, preferably a distributed one with a web
interface similar to that found on popular code-hosting websites such as GitHub.
The legislation shall be stored in this VCS in an open text-based format that
allows for easy diffing, grepping, and manipulation by other similar software tools
designed to operate on text-based formats.
