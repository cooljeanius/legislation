0. The title of this legislation shall be the "Securing Our Freedom To Write
And Read Everything (SOFTWARE) Act".
1. Definitions. 
 1a. Free Software
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, "Free software" shall mean software that 
respects users' freedom and community. It shall mean that for software to be 
considered "Free software" under New Hampshire law, it must be software that 
guarantees its users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and 
improve the software. Thus, for the purposes of New Hampshire law, "free software"
shall be considered a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept,
interpreters of this legislation should think of "free" as in "free speech," or as
in "Live Free or Die," not as in "free beer". Sometimes it is called
"libre software," borrowing the French or Spanish word for "free" as in 
freedom, to show that the person using the term does not mean the software is
gratis. Given that English does not have this same "libre/gratis" distinction
that the Romance languages do, sometimes this legislation shall use alternate
terms to clarify which is meant: "Free-and-open-source software (FOSS)",
"Freedom-preserving software", and "Software that is free-as-in-freedom" may all
be used to mean "Free software" in the sense of "libre software", while the term
"Freeware" may be used to mean "Free software" in the sense of "gratis software".
 1b. Copyleft
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, "copyleft" shall be defined as the practice
of using copyright law to ensure that any free intellectual property, in particular
free software, remains free even after redistribution, modification, and use. A
"copyleft software license" is a license designed specifically to facilitate the
use of copyright in this way. A "copyleft free software project" is a collaborative
project with the aim of developing software with such a license. The term
"copyleft" may also be used as a verb, meaning to release a product under such a
license.
 1c. App store
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, an "app store" shall be defined as any
online software distribution platform in which one company allows other developers
to sell software to end-users for download.
 1d. Patch (in the context of software development)
For the purposes of this legislation, the term "patch", as used in the context of
software development, shall refer to a set of changes to a computer program or its
supporting data that are intended to update, fix, or improve it.
 1e. Upstream/downstream (in the context of software development)
For the purposes of this legislation, the term "upstream", as
used in the context of software development, shall refer to the original authors
or maintainers of a software project, while the term "downstream", used in the
same context, shall refer to redistributors or repackagers of a software project
away from its upstream maintainers.
 1f. Fork (in the context of software development)
For the purposes of this legislation, the term "fork", as used in the context of
software development, shall be defined as a copy of a software project in which
a subset of its developers use its source code to begin independent development
of the project in a different direction, resulting in a distinct and separate
piece of software.
 1g. Noncompete clause
(may already be defined somewhere in NH law; would have to check)
2. Legal status of copyleft
 2a. In general
The State of New Hampshire officially recognizes copyleft as a valid, beneficent,
and commendable form of copyright.
 2b. In civil suits
Any copyright holder for a copyleft free software project has a right to defend
civil claims against their project in New Hampshire courts. Free software projects
using copyleft shall enjoy presumptions in their favor in New Hampshire courts,
given all other aspects of their cases being equal.
 2c. Between different versions of the same project
In cases where there are multiple versions of the same copylefted free software
project, applying a patch between upstream and downstream instances of that
project, that hold the same free copyleft license, and differ only in copyright
holder, or, in cases where copyright holder is the same, differ only in author,
shall always be legal in the state of New Hampshire.
3. Relative to noncompete clauses adversely affecting contribution to Free Software
projects
No noncompete clause by which an employer prevents an employee from contributing
to a Free Software project they might wish to contribute to, shall be enforced in
the State of New Hampshire.
4. Relative to the state government usage of external software
 4a. Study committee
Whereas the state government currently uses much proprietary software in its
day-to-day business, this legislation shall provide for the creation of a study
committee to study the possible costs and feasibility of replacing all proprietary
software used by state government with free software, to be done by a date of the
committee's choosing. [TODO: specify composition of committee]
 4b. Funding
This legislation authorizes the spending of money to transition from proprietary
software to free software at the recommendation of the study committee, the
precise amounts of which are to be appropriated in future state budgets.
5. Relative to the state government's writing of its own software
 5a. Public domain vs. copyleft
Currently, it is this understanding of this legislator that any software funded
by state tax dollars are NOT subject to copyright, and are thus released into
the public domain. This legislation shall modify state law to clarify that any
software released by the State of New Hampshire may be released under a free
copyleft license instead, at the determination of the State Department of
Information Technology. In such cases, the copyright holder of such software
shall be considered to be the entire State of New Hampshire, claims against
which are to be defended by the State Department of Justice.
6. Relative to app stores with terms of service that prohibit distribution of
software with copyleft software licenses
(do something about them... ban? tax? make liable to civil suits?)
7. Legal assistance for developers of Free Software
Any indigent developer of free-and-open-source software who would qualify for 
defense by a public defender in a criminal case may also qualify for legal 
assistance from the public defenders' office in civil disputes arising from the 
copyright of software they develop under a copyleft license.
8. Relative to evidence in criminal law created by proprietary software
All defendants in cases of criminal law in the State of New Hampshire shall have 
the right, either on their own or thru their legal representation, to review the 
source code of any proprietary software used to generate evidence being used 
against them in court, in order to guarantee the reliability of said evidence.
9. Software the government requires civilians to use
No person in the State of New Hampshire shall be required to use proprietary 
software for any interaction with the government that is required by law, including
but not limited to: the filing or payment of taxes, remote appearance for court 
proceedings, the taking of standardized tests or the completion of coursework by
school students, applying for or receiving unemployment benefits (or other similar
benefits), [...]
Furthermore, no person in the State of New Hampshire shall be required to allow
the execution of proprietary javascript in their browser when visiting websites
administered by the State of New Hampshire. The State Department of Information
Technology shall verify that this is the case via the use of browser extensions
of their choice that are designed to detect and block the execution of proprietary
javascript in their browsers.
10. Data portability
The State of New Hampshire recognizes a fundamental right to data portability held
by computer users, and shall enact policies to ensure that the right to data
portability is protected.
