0. The title of this legislation shall be the "Securing Our Freedom To Write
And Read Everything (SOFTWARE) Act".
1. Definitions. 
 1a. Free Software
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, "Free software" shall mean software that 
respects users' freedom and community. It shall mean that for software to be 
considered "Free software" under New Hampshire law, it must be software that 
guarantees its users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and 
improve the software. Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To 
understand the concept, interpreters of this legislation should think of "free" as 
in "free speech," or as in "Live Free or Die," not as in "free beer". Sometimes it 
is called "libre software," borrowing the French or Spanish word for "free" as in 
freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. Given that English does not 
have this same "libre/gratis" distinction that the Romance languages do, sometimes 
this legislation shall use alternate terms to clarify which is meant: 
"Free-and-open-source software (FOSS)", "Freedom-preserving software", and 
"Software that is free-as-in-freedom" may all be used to mean "Free software" in 
the sense of "libre software", while the term "Freeware" may be used to mean 
"Free software" in the sense of "gratis software".

assistance from the public defenders' office in civil disputes arising from the 
copyright of software they develop under a copyleft license.
8. Relative to evidence in criminal law created by proprietary software
All defendants in cases of criminal law in the State of New Hampshire shall have

source code of any proprietary software used to generate evidence being used 
against them in court, in order to guarantee the reliability of said evidence.
9. Software the government requires civilians to use
