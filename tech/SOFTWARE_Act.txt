0. The title of this legislation shall be the "Securing Our Freedom To Write
And Read Everything (SOFTWARE) Act".
1. Definitions. 
 1a. Free Software
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, "Free software" shall mean software that 
respects users' freedom and community. It shall mean that for software to be 
considered "Free software" under New Hampshire law, it must be software that 
guarantees its users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and 
improve the software. Thus, for the purposes of New Hampshire law, "free software"
shall be considered a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept,
interpreters of this legislation should think of "free" as in "free speech," or as
in "Live Free or Die," not as in "free beer". Sometimes it is called
"libre software," borrowing the French or Spanish word for "free" as in 
freedom, to show that the person using the term does not mean the software is
gratis. Given that English does not have this same "libre/gratis" distinction
that the Romance languages do, sometimes this legislation shall use alternate
terms to clarify which is meant: "Free-and-open-source software (FOSS)",
"Freedom-preserving software", and "Software that is free-as-in-freedom" may all
be used to mean "Free software" in the sense of "libre software", while the term
"Freeware" may be used to mean "Free software" in the sense of "gratis software".
 1b. Copyleft
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, "copyleft" shall be defined as... (TODO)
 1c. App store
For the purposes of New Hampshire law, an "app store" shall be defined as... (TODO)
 1d. Patch (in the context of software development)
 1e. Upstream/downstream (in the context of software development)
 1f. Fork (in the context of software development)
2. Legal status of copyleft
 2a. In general
The State of New Hampshire officially recognizes copyleft as a valid, beneficent,
and commendable form of copyright.
 2b. In civil suits
... (TODO)
 2c. Between different versions of the same project
... (TODO)
3. Relative to noncompete clauses affecting contribution to Free Software projects
(make nonenforceable in NH)
4. Relative to the state government usage of external software
 4a. Study committee
Whereas the state government currently uses much proprietary software in its
day-to-day business, this legislation shall provide for the creation of a study
committee to study the possible costs and feasibility of replacing all proprietary
software used by state government with free software, to be done by a date of the
committee's choosing. [TODO: specify composition of committee]
5. Relative to the state government's writing of its own software
 5a. Public domain vs. copyleft
Currently, it is this understanding of this legislator that any software funded
by state tax dollars are NOT subject to copyright, and are thus released into
the public domain. This legislation shall modify state law to clarify that any
software released by the State of New Hampshire may be released under a copyleft
license instead, at the determination of the State Department of Information
Technology. In such cases, the copyright holder of such software shall be
considered to be the entire State of New Hampshire, claims against which are to
be defended by the State Department of Justice.
6. Relative to app stores that prohibit copyleft software licenses
(do something about them... ban? tax? make liable to civil suits?)
7. Legal assistance for developers of Free Software
Any indigent developer of free-and-open-source software who would qualify for 
defense by a public defender in a criminal case may also qualify for legal 
assistance from the public defenders' office in civil disputes arising from the 
copyright of software they develop under a copyleft license.
8. Relative to evidence in criminal law created by proprietary software
All defendants in cases of criminal law in the State of New Hampshire shall have 
the right, either on their own or thru their legal representation, to review the 
source code of any proprietary software used to generate evidence being used 
against them in court, in order to guarantee the reliability of said evidence.
9. Software the government requires civilians to use
No person in the State of New Hampshire shall be required to use proprietary 
software for any interaction with the government that is required by law, including
but not limited to: the filing or payment of taxes, remote appearance for court 
proceedings, the taking of standardized tests or the completion of coursework by
school students, applying for or receiving unemployment benefits (or other similar
benefits), [...]
