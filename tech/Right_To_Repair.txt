0. Relative to the right to repair
(There was already right to repair legislation filed this last term, so under rule
36(e) I was prohibited from bringing it forward again that term... that's over now,
though...)

However, now that next term is coming up... Get in touch with Dave Luneau about
bringing it back next year (it was HB449 in the 2021 session)

This is LSR 2023-0186 for the 2023 session, which then became HB73:
